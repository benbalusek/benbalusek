    lyrics: `Where are you now?
    The past is inside of us
    How do I love?
    What’s holding me down?
    What’s lost is what’s yet to be found
    And I know
    Your face in my dreams
    The world is alive, everything inside us
    All form entropy
    Your words, they sing
    
    Light, take me home
    See the moon, feeling your soul
    Love, all is love
    Sun and moon, know they are one
    
    Who are we now?
    The earth holds the truth in the ground
    I want to tear it all down
    The heavens they speak for themselves
    And I know
    What they look like
    Turn off your phone, go outside
    And drive out past city lights
    Your world, it shines
    
    Light, take me home
    See the moon, feeling your soul
    Love, all is love
    Sun and moon, know they are one`,

    songTitle: "Here in my World",
    lyrics: `Walking in this place
    I can see patterns in the space
    Pictures are singing their embrace
    I can be happy

    If when looking at a tree
    I can see it is just a tree
    A living, perceiving entity
    We are this place

    Here in my world
    I can hear the birds
    I read your pain online
    I feel your pain

    Talking in your sleep
    I respond, Taylor, you hear me
    Are you still inside your dream
    Are you happy

    Waking up at dawn
    I can see the sun is being born
    Clouds above are making love
    Was I dreaming

    Our car is freezing cold
    On the side of this old road
    My bladder might explode
    We are living

    Here in my world
    I can hear the birds
    I saw your pain online
    I feel your pain

    Here in my world
    I drive through deserts
    You are the thing you need
    You are me`,

    songTitle: "Death and Beauty",
    lyrics: `Laying in the grass in front of me
    I see you in me
    Death and beauty
    Love is empathy
    We’re inside of everything I know
    
    I really don’t know
    Are we eternal or was it placebo?
    
    Trading all our love for vanity
    Our humanity for a plastic screen
    We are thirsty but our god is dead
    
    I know I really want to come home
    But I think it’s all meaningful
    
    Let it die
    Peace inside
    When patterns in my mind unwind
    All is
    
    One day, you’re bigger than the rest of us
    How do I trust you when your goal is authority?
    Losing sanity for a chance to have control
    
    I know I could really learn to love my ego
    But I don’t think I want to be you
    
    Let it grow
    In this present moment
    We are the same
    God is everything
    
    Let yourself let go
    We are eternal
    The Christ and the Buddha
    Are asking us to love
    
    Let it die
    Peace inside
    When patterns in my mind unwind
    All is one`,

    songTitle: "New World",
    lyrics: `These days 
    Stuck in a mirror
    I stare at my phone when it tells me to
    Out of view, out of space
    Is what we create worth all that we take away
    
    I, I know you want change 
    But change don’t come unless it comes from you
    I know you want peace but saving trees won’t grow economies
    I know you want a new world, well so do I
    I know you want to write it all down
    Take a train to the coast
    Haunt my brain as your words become part of your ghost
    
    Undiagnosed 
    As we take more than we need from everything
    Call an attack 
    When we don’t get what we want, we don’t just push back
    
    I, I know you want change 
    But change don’t come unless it comes from you
    I know you want peace but polices are bought by industries
    I know you want a new world, another time
    I know you want to get the hell out
    Sleep outside by a stream
    Have a vision of all as you fall back asleep
    
    I know you well
    I know you want a new world`,

    lyrics: `Streetlights, where are you?
    What do you see?
    I see the moon
    Seeing the world away from you 
    On my bed 
    Wherever I decide to sleep
    I wish you were there
    On my bed
    
    No more space for the objects we create
    I want to let go
    The information age didn’t give us what we need 
    Time to change
    
    Waking from a dream
    This city breathes
    I hold my breath, listening 
    For a vision we haven’t seen 
    Who are we
    If we refuse to show empathy?
    Look in the mirror
    Who are we?
    
    We know but we don’t want to change 
    We change but we don’t want to know 
    We know but we don’t want to change 
    You know but you don’t want to know 
    Oh there ain’t no place left to go 
    We know but we don’t want to know
    Oh I know but I don’t want to change 
    We change but we don’t want to know 
    
    No more space for the objects we create
    I want to let go
    The information age didn’t give us what we need 
    Time to change
    
    No more hate, no more 
    No more shame, no more 
    No more fear, no more 
    No more greed, no more 
    No more doubt, no more 
    No more regret, no more`,

    A million miles away
    Will I go or will I stay?
    Will I pass away?
    
    Can’t conceive not to be
    All I know is all I see
    Do you see me in your dreams?
    Learn to think to learn to look to
    Learn to find out that you don’t know anything
    
    Holding on
    Cause I can’t let things go
    A part of you is a part of my soul
    A part of me is somewhere
    
    Can’t conceive not to be
    All I know is all I see
    Do you see me in your dreams?
    Learn to think to learn to look to
    Learn to find out that you don’t know anything
